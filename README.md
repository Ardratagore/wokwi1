# FROG 4-bit CPU

The FROG is a tiny 4-bit processor intended to be incorporated into the [TinyTapeout](https://mailchi.mp/574276e3c9d7/tinytapeout) multi-project chip on a multi-project wafer

The [Makefile](Makefile) has been modified to support the same github action as the template repository without actually pulling from Wokwi.
