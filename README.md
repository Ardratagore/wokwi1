This is two small implementations of a CD4518 BCD counter chip using wokwi for tiny tapeout. You can see the schematics at https://wokwi.com/projects/340979268609638995.
It isnt entirely clear to me if the first design will work as it relies on an asynchronous reset for overflow, but the second design is synchronous and so should work
better.
